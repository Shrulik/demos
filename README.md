=============

A very simple app, I build as part of a demo of AngularJS and Play Framework in Java, with Hibernate for persistence.
This is the end result expected at the end of the demo.

Most of the code to build this, is available as IntelliJ live templates,
with https://github.com/Shrulik/play-jpa-seed as the starting point.
